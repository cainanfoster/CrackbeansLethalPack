# ReservedItemSlotCore
<strong>The core mod for all ReservedItemSlot mods.</strong><br>
This mod is required for my ReservedItemSlot mods to work, such as ReservedFlashlightSlot and ReservedWalkieSlot.<br>
These mods will give you free dedicated inventory slots for their respective item(s). These slots will be shown on the right side of your screen, stacking vertically.<br>
<br>
You cannot switch to these slots manually by scrolling. Instead, the method for swapping to these items is to hold Alt, and scrolling up and down to switch between them. (patch 1.2.1)<br>
This way, you can swap to these items to drop them, as well as other actions, such as charging, storing, etc.<br>
<br>
Grabbing reserved items, as well as switching between the main hotbar and reserved hotbar slots should sync between clients using this mod. (patch 1.2.5)<br>
If relevant, these mods will have dedicated keybinds to activate the items without needing to have them currently selected.<br>

## Mod compatibility
+ HotbarPlus is compatible!
+ LethalThings Utility Belt is now compatible!
+ Other mods that can add hotbar slots are not guaranteed to work.
+ Other mods that might re-arrange the hotbar slots (HUD) are not guaranteed to play nicely with these mods, but <i>might</i> technically work.

## Referencing this mod
I do apologize, but this mod wasn't built around the idea that others would be able to create their own ReservedItemSlot mods.<br>
The main reason is that I often restructure this core mod, and as a result, I would likely be breaking many references and compatibility with other ReservedItemSlot mods not made by me, and I don't like doing that to people.<br>
Maybe in the near future I'll take the time to restructure it to a point where I don't think I will have to edit the core mod, but only time will tell.<br>
If there is a ReservedItemSlot mod that you would like, feel free to shoot me a request on the Lethal Company Modding discord.<br>
If you are insistent on making your own ReservedItemSlot mod for your own reason, also let me know in the discord and we can talk about it, and I could potentially give your assembly internal access to this mod.<br>
