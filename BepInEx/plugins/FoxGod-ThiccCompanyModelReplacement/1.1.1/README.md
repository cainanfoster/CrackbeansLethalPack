### Feel free to follow my twitter @Meme_Hokage for updates


## Manual Install Instructions
- Place contents in plugins folder. Ensure that ModelReplacementAPI is also installed. 
- Set your preferred replacement suits in the config, or enable thicc for all suits. By default the starting suit is replaced. 
- For more info see https://github.com/BunyaPineTree/LethalCompany_ModelReplacementAPI

## Known Issues
- Physics can be laggy. Physics configs temporarily unavalible since ModelReplacementAPI has moved away from dynamic bones. 
- Might look odd in bad lighting.  
- Does not replace hands. You will only see the model in multiplayer lobbies or with a third person mod. 
- VERY scuffed and not perfect
- Some animations seem off due to the model having more bones in the rig that cause arms to seem longer. 
## Note
Version 1.1.1 and up will require ModelReplacementAPI minimum version 2.2.1. Be sure to download the latest update of that as well.
